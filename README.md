so header is semantic, to describe that it's a header, cute
        is there a way of inventing your own tags for html? yessir
    
    <style type="text/css">
    angrydiv { background: red; color: white; display: block; }
    </style>

    <angrydiv>Arrrg!</angrydiv>

AND IT WORKS!!!

CSS STANDARD LAYOUT

element { <!--you can use a .element if you want to incorporate class-->
 property: value;
}
fun fact you can also do, 

element, element, {
    prop:val;
}

which i think is veryyy cool 

okay so what does rel mean, because i know it's for stylesheets but wag1 with it fr??
.....its for relationship!!! so link rel=stylesheet means its the stylesheet for the given html

hmmm--RESPONSIVE TINGS
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute. 

Add the following within the head element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width= device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
SO THE VARIABLE NAME when you check pon the javascripp gives you a humble viewport sef, and then the content, kinda like style is thaat the width of said sontent should be the same width as the device

fka responsive design

and burlywood is #deb887
i think it makes sense to use percentages instead of pixels for sizing inna css as then it translates on the mobile thing....

TO REITERATE
 center a div with margin auto settings

 sorry since when could you use an url to change a background image???


 WHAT DOES SPACEBAR MEAN IN CSS SCHOOL OF PARENTING???

inline-block elements only take up the width of their content. so "french vanilla" is like 2cm
