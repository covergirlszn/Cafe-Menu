so header is semantic, to describe that it's a header, cute
        is there a way of inventing your own tags for html?

CSS STANDARD LAYOUT

element { <!--you can use a .element if you want to incorporate class-->
 property: value;
}
fun fact you can also do, 

element, element, {
    prop:val;
}

which i think is veryyy cool
