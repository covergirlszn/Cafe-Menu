so header is semantic, to describe that it's a header, cute
        is there a way of inventing your own tags for html?

CSS STANDARD LAYOUT

element { <!--you can use a .element if you want to incorporate class-->
 property: value;
}
fun fact you can also do, 

element, element, {
    prop:val;
}

which i think is veryyy cool 

okay so what does rel mean, because i know it's for stylesheets but wag1 with it fr??

hmmm--RESPONSIVE TINGS
For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute. 

Add the following within the head element:

<meta name="viewport" content="width= device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
SO THE VARIABLE NAME when you check pon the javascripp gives you a humble viewport sef, and then the content, kinda like style is thaat the width of said sontent should be the same width as the device
